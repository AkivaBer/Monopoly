# Monopoly AI
The goal of this project is to create the world's most 
intelligent Monopoly AI. Many of the AIs commercially found are
woefully misguided in how they choose to trade, purchase properties,
and overall interact with real world players. The algorithms, which
I don't have access to, seem to incorrectly be willing to compromise on short
term monetary advantage over a long-term property based leverage. House
building seems to also be weirdly decided in the EA Sports version
of the game
